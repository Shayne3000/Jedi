# Jedi
Jedi is an app written in Kotlin that triages the use of:

- ComposeUI for the UI framework, 
- Room for persistence, 
- Retrofit for networking,
- Moshi for JSON parsing,
- Hilt for dependency injection,
- Coroutines for asynchronous execution, 
- Flow for observable data streams,
- and some other Jetpack components

in building an offline-first app that showcases the users of the force in a galaxy far, far away.
